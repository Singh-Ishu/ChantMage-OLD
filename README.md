# Chant Mage

##NOTE: This project has been abandoned and i have no plans of continuing it as of now. I might come back to it someday to finish it but no plans of it as such.
The project was initially made as a "short hackathon scrap project" and thus I didn't use any frameworks or technologies that something like this needs.
While it is possible to implement and finish this is HTML, CSS and plain JS it is simply pointless. I am currently reworking this using Unreal so that it can be
executed to a level a game like this deserves.

## The Game:
Chant Mage is an immersive offline RPG built entirely in html, CSS, and VanillaJavaScript, where your voice is your greatest weapon.
Step into the boots of a powerful mage, capable of conjuring spells by uttering their ancient names.
Duke it out in magical duels where strategy, timing, and mastery of spells determine whether you emerge victorious or fall to the arcane chaos.

## The Gameplay:
### Getting Started
* Movement: Use the arrow keys to navigate the dungeon’s twisting hallways, dodge traps, and position yourself strategically for battles.
* Voice-Activated Spells: The heart of the game lies in your voice. Speak aloud ancient incantations to cast powerful spells, summon defenses, or heal your wounds.
### Combat Mechanics
* Chant to Attack: Each spell has a unique chant you must pronounce correctly to activate. Timing and accuracy are crucial—mispronouncing or hesitating could leave you vulnerable!
* Strategize Your Spells: Manage your mana wisely and use your spells effectively. Some enemies are weak against specific types of magic, so choose your chants carefully.
* Dodge and Defend: Use the arrow keys to evade attacks or position yourself for the next spell.
### Objectives
* Clear the Dungeon: Fight your way through hordes of magical enemies and deadly traps to advance deeper into the dungeon.
* Uncover Secrets: Solve puzzles and find hidden lore pieces that reveal the dungeon’s dark mysteries.
* Survive the Final Test: The deeper you go, the greater the danger. Do you have what it takes to face what lies at the dungeon’s heart?

## The Setup:
The code has been created with simple testing in mind, to run the webpage, download or clone the repo to your local device
and then open the index.html file in the Web folder.
